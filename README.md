## What is this?

This is the public-facing git repository for Michael Donnelly (miked3 aka miked3dev).
As of January 2022 I am working as a freelance software developer, with interests in
web development (front- and back-end), mobile devices (especially Android), UI design,
data analytics and visualization, and Linux web and system administration.

## About Me

In the first part of my career, I was trained in experimental psychology, with a 
specialization in Vision Science, and worked on projects that involved sensory, cognitive,
behavioral and emotional processes. I spent a lot of time studying (and teaching!) 
the basic methods used in all of these areas, as well as quite a bit of work in
what is now Systems Neuroscience, using measurement technologies such as fMRI, EEG,
and a variety of others.

At about the time the pandemic hit, my interests changed and I decided to plunge into 
learning computer and network technology. I enrolled at a local Tech College ([CVTC](https://cvtc.edu) )
and their Software Development program. Their program gives students basic skills 
in the development of what are usually called web applications, with an emphasis on
the languages that dominate that space: Javascript and Java, but also PHP, C#, and a
few others.

I finished that program at the end of 2021, and now I find myself engage in freelance
project work, some self-assigned and some for clients, while I continue to train in
the skills that I hope to use to find my next big adventure.
 
## About My Repos

I plan to use Github to create public-facing repos of my work. Some was completed while
I was a student, and others are ongoing. As a result, they should demonstrate a highly
variable range of skill levels. If you find anything here worth using, my only requirement
is some sort of acknowledgement. Give credit where credit is due. My policy is to do the
same, and so you find acknowledgements sprinkled through the source code, as well as the
occasional URI where you can find the original stuff.

I hope you find something in here that you can use.
